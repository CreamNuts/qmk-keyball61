# Custom Keymap for Keyball 61

Original keymap is [here](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball)
For `qmk>0.24.0`, change `#define SPLIT_HAND_MATRIX_GRID` to `#define SPLIT_HAND_MATRIX_GRID_LOW_IS_LEFT` in the [base config](https://github.com/Yowkees/keyball/blob/main/qmk_firmware/keyboards/keyball/keyball61/config.h).
> If you feel your keymap doesn't apply, try to clear EEPROM.
